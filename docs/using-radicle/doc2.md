title: Creating and sharing projects

In Radicle, local git repositories are published and shared as *projects*. Projects contain all of files of a repository and stores each file's revision history. It also carries a unique, shareable peer-to-peer identitifer known as a projectID. In Radicle, a project also includes the identities of all its maintainers: peers with designated rights over the project's metadata. To read more about how projects are replicated across the Radicle network, head to our Understanding Radicle section.

## Creating a project

Creating a project is as easy as creating a repository in git. In the Upstream client, you can create a project from scratch or from an existing repository. If creating from scratch, the client will create a new git repository in the location you choose. 

## Sharing a project

While you will be able to search for projects directly on Radicle using the projectID, the only way to currently do so is to add another user as a remote to your project. For instructions on how to do this, head to [Adding remotes & pulling changes](using-radicle/doc2-3.md)
